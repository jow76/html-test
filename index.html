                <h3>Types of red panda</h3>
                <p>There are two different types of red pandas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Himalayan</li>
                    <li>Chinese</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Chinese subspecies is usually larger and their fur has a deeper red colour. Their tails are also more defined, where the red is darker and the white is lighter.</p>
